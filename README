This is a small collection of scripts meant to ease the 
deployment of wine apps on a multi user system.

The scripts are as follows:

launch.sh
	This script uses rsync to sync the base wine prefix 
	to a wine prefix local to the user. It will then 
	link in static content from the Base prefix in 
	order to reduce the overall wasted disk space. 
	Feedback to the user is provided in the form of a
	Zenity dialogue box.

cfg/config
	Application specific configuration.  Application 
	Name, local install location, etc..

cfg/run_.sh
	Used to run an arbitrary wine applcation in the 
	base prefix, install files and the like.

cfg/winecfg.sh
	Runs winecfg in the correct prefix.
	
cfg/winetricks.sh
	Gets the most recent version of winetricks from
	http://winetricks.org and runs it in the correct
	prefix.

I hope to expand on this small collection of scripts to 
allow for different versions of wine to be included in an 
application bottle.
